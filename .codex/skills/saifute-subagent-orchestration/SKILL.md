description: Orchestrate non-trivial delivery work in the Saifute NestJS WMS repository with Codex-style subagents and durable handoffs. Use when work is ambiguous, cross-cutting, high-risk, resumable, migration-style, or when the user explicitly wants delegation, parallel agent work, or subagents. Skip this skill for tiny, clear, low-risk edits that can be handled directly in the parent.

# Saifute Subagent Orchestration

Use this skill for the repository's heavy delivery lane.

Stay on the direct lane for tiny, clear, low-risk edits. Use this skill when the task needs durable task state, explicit role boundaries, or Codex subagent coordination.

This skill is the entrypoint. The reusable subagent handoff templates live under `.codex/agents/`:

- `.codex/agents/planner.md`
- `.codex/agents/coder.md`
- `.codex/agents/code-reviewer.md`
- `.codex/agents/acceptance-qa.md`

When the user explicitly asks for subagents, read the matching template and pass its task-local subset into `spawn_agent`.

subagent model:

- `$saifute-planner`: `model: gpt-5.4`, `reasoning_effort: high`
- `$saifute-coder`: `model: gpt-5.4`, `reasoning_effort: high`
- `$saifute-code-reviewer`: `model: gpt-5.4`, `reasoning_effort: high`
- `$saifute-acceptance-qa`: `model: gpt-5.4`, `reasoning_effort: high`

## Codex-specific rules

- Only use `spawn_agent` when the user explicitly asks for subagents, delegation, or parallel agent work.
- Always inject the mapped `model` and `reasoning_effort` for the selected repository subagent.
- Keep the critical path local. Do not delegate the immediate blocking step if the parent can do it directly faster.
- Prefer `worker` for `$saifute-planner`, `$saifute-coder`, and `$saifute-acceptance-qa` when they need write access.
- Prefer `explorer` or `default` for readonly discovery and for `$saifute-code-reviewer` when review is purely informational.
- Launch multiple writers only when writable scopes are explicitly disjoint before launch.
- Keep shared files parent-owned by default unless one worker is explicitly assigned sole ownership.

## Choose the lane

Stay on the lightweight direct lane when most of these are true:

- the change is limited to one file or a very small path set
- no cross-module design choice is needed
- no migration, backfill, reconciliation, or cutover semantics are involved
- no frozen or shared contract is being rewritten
- no durable `docs/tasks/*.md` handoff is needed for resume
- focused local validation is enough

Use the heavy lane when any of these are true:

- the task is non-trivial, ambiguous, cross-cutting, or high-risk
- the user asks to continue, resume, or pick up durable work
- the task needs a task doc, review loop, or acceptance loop
- the work touches migration, backfill, reconciliation, staging, or cutover readiness
- the user explicitly asks for delegation, subagents, or parallel agent work

## Read the minimum source of truth first

Before delegating, read only the smallest relevant set:

- relevant requirement docs under `docs/requirements/**`, when requirement-driven
- `docs/tasks/TASK_CENTER.md`, `docs/requirements/REQUIREMENT_CENTER.md`, and `docs/workspace/DASHBOARD.md` when resuming
- the active `docs/tasks/*.md` for the current scope, when present
- `docs/architecture/00-architecture-overview.md`
- relevant module docs under `docs/architecture/modules/**`
- directly related code, schema, scripts, config, or tests
- `.cursor/skills/saifute-subagent-orchestration/reference.md` when you need the role matrix or shared-file reminders

For migration, backfill, reconciliation, or cutover-prep work, also read:

- `docs/architecture/30-java-to-nestjs-data-migration-reference.md`
- `docs/architecture/20-wms-database-tables-and-schema.md` when inventory, workflow, reporting, reservation, or business-state semantics are affected

## Heavy-lane shape

Use only the stages the task actually needs:

1. `planner`
2. `coder`
3. `code-reviewer`
4. fix loop until blocking and important findings are cleared
5. `acceptance-qa` when independent requirement or user-flow verification is needed

This is not a mandatory planner-first state machine.

- Start at `coder` when an active task doc already gives a clear execution brief.
- Start at `code-reviewer` when the user asks for review or only an independent review pass is missing.
- Start at `acceptance-qa` only when the selected acceptance path or the user request needs it.
- Return to `planner` only when the requirement, scope, or task-doc truth needs repair.

## Role boundaries

- `planner`: create or repair a durable handoff under `docs/tasks/**`
- `coder`: implement inside explicit writable scope
- `code-reviewer`: find bugs, regressions, contract drift, and validation gaps
- `acceptance-qa`: verify requirement-level or user-flow completion
- `explorer`: readonly discovery support only

Enforce these rules:

- let `planner` edit only `docs/tasks/**`
- treat `docs/tasks/**` as read-only for `coder` unless ownership was explicitly reassigned
- route any open blocking or important review finding back to `coder`, then rerun `code-reviewer`
- use `acceptance-qa` for `Acceptance mode = full`, independent browser verification, or explicit end-to-end confirmation

## Frozen repository constraints

Never let subagents bypass these repository rules:

- `inventory-core` is the only stock write entry point
- `workflow` owns audit-document behavior and review-state semantics
- `session` uses JWT as a session ticket, with Redis as the session source of truth
- `rbac` owns permission strings, route trees, and data-scope policies
- `ai-assistant` may orchestrate and query tools, but must not write business data directly

## Close the loop

Before stopping a non-trivial task, capture continuation-critical state in durable docs instead of chat memory alone.

Make sure the handoff records:

- current status
- what changed this turn
- validation run and result
- remaining blockers, risks, sign-off needs, or pending gates
- the next recommended step
