# agent-browser Reference

Verified on `2026-04-02`.

This note explains how agents in this repository should use `agent-browser` for browser-based testing and acceptance work.

## Upstream Reference

There is an external GitHub tutorial that matches the workflow validated here:

- Vercel Labs `agent-browser` README:
  - Quick start: [github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser#quick-start](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser#quick-start)
  - Agent instructions section: [github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser#agentsmd--claudemd](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser#agentsmd--claudemd)

That tutorial describes the same core pattern:

1. open a page
2. get a snapshot of interactive elements
3. interact using snapshot references
4. re-snapshot after page changes

Our repository should follow that same pattern directly through the `agent-browser` CLI.

Use the CLI directly, especially these commands:

- `open`
- `snapshot`
- `fill`
- `click`
- `press` / `keyboard type`
- `wait`
- `network requests`
- `network request`
- `screenshot`

## When To Use It

Use `agent-browser` whenever the task needs real browser behavior, for example:

- login and route-entry smoke tests
- browser-side acceptance for user flows
- page rendering or visible-action checks
- network evidence for browser-triggered API calls
- reproducing a UI bug that cannot be confirmed from code or API tests alone

Do not mix `agent-browser` evidence with ad hoc manual Chrome steps in the same acceptance conclusion unless the task doc explicitly records that exception.

In this repository, if the task or acceptance doc says browser work should use `agent-browser`, do not silently substitute Chrome DevTools MCP or another browser channel. Use the CLI directly unless the doc explicitly records an exception.

## Verified Working Flow

The following flow was validated in this environment.

### 1. Open Or Reuse A Page

- Use `agent-browser open <url>` to navigate the active session.
- Use `--session <name>` to isolate one task from another.
- Reuse the same session when you want page state, refs, cookies, or browser history to persist.

### 2. Snapshot Before Interacting

- Always call `agent-browser snapshot` before clicking or filling.
- Prefer snapshot refs like `@e2`, `@e3`, not guessed CSS selectors.
- After navigation or a DOM refresh, run `snapshot` again because old refs may no longer be valid.

### 3. Drive The UI

- Use `fill @ref "value"` for inputs.
- Use `click @ref` for buttons, links, and toggles.
- Use `press` or `keyboard type` only when direct `fill` is not enough.
- Use `wait --text "..."` or another wait mode to confirm the expected result before concluding the check passed.

### 4. Capture Browser Evidence

- Use `network requests` to see the request list for the current page.
- Use `network request <id>` to inspect a specific request entry.
- Use `screenshot <path>` when visual evidence is useful for the task doc or handoff.

## Smoke Validation Performed

Two live checks were run while preparing this reference.

### DOM Interaction Smoke

- Opened a `data:` page containing a username field, password field, login button, and result text.
- Ran `agent-browser --session codex-verify snapshot -i --json` and received stable refs:
  - `e2` -> `Login`
  - `e3` -> `Username`
  - `e4` -> `Password`
- Ran:
  - `fill @e3 'agent-smoke'`
  - `fill @e4 'secret123'`
  - `click @e2`
  - `wait --text 'Login OK for agent-smoke'`
  - `eval 'document.body.innerText'`
- The final body text was:
  - `Agent Browser CLI Smoke\nUsername Password Login\nLogin OK for agent-smoke`

Conclusion: `agent-browser` can successfully open a page, snapshot DOM, fill fields by ref, click controls by ref, wait on visible results, and read page state.

### Navigation And Network Smoke

- Navigated to `https://example.com`.
- Ran:
  - `open https://example.com`
  - `wait --load networkidle`
  - `snapshot -i`
  - `network requests`
  - `screenshot /Users/sft/Projects/saifute-wms-server-nestjs/.tmp-agent-browser-cli-example.png`
- Snapshot showed:
  - heading `Example Domain` -> `e1`
  - link `Learn more` -> `e2`
- `network requests` showed:
  - `GET https://example.com/ (Document) 200`
  - `GET https://example.com/favicon.ico (Other) 404`
- `network request <id>` was also callable and returned the selected request URL.

Conclusion: `agent-browser` can provide browser-side navigation, wait conditions, request listings, per-request inspection, and screenshots.

## Recommended Testing Pattern

For browser-based task verification, use this order:

1. Ensure the target environment is reachable.
2. Open the page with `agent-browser --session <name> open <url>`.
3. Run `agent-browser --session <name> snapshot -i` or `snapshot -i --json`.
4. Interact using snapshot refs like `@e2`.
5. Confirm UI result with `wait`.
6. Inspect network requests when the check depends on API success.
7. Save a screenshot only when the visual state matters.
8. Record the exact page, account, scenario, and evidence in the task or acceptance doc.

## Evidence Template

When writing browser evidence into a task or acceptance run, keep it concrete:

- environment: base URL and relevant backend URL
- account: which user was used
- pages or routes covered
- visible result observed
- key request URLs and status codes
- whether screenshots were captured

Avoid vague statements like `browser smoke passed` without naming the checked routes or evidence.

## Environment-Sensitive Login Checks

Before automating a login flow, verify live assumptions that may be controlled by env:

- If captcha, SSO, or route guards are env-driven, probe the live backend first.
- In this repo, `GET /api/auth/captcha` is the fastest truth source for whether captcha is enabled in the running backend.
- After the backend probe, open the login page with `agent-browser` and confirm the rendered form with `snapshot -i`.

Recommended sequence:

1. Check the live backend endpoint that controls the login assumption.
2. Open the login page.
3. Snapshot the interactive elements.
4. Only then script the login flow.

Trust the live endpoint plus the current browser snapshot over a stale assumption from an earlier run.

## Async Dropdown Verification

Async selects can briefly show typed text, input-method suggestions, or transient UI echoes that look like real options.

Do not conclude from that transient state alone. For remote-search dropdown checks:

1. Trigger the search in the browser.
2. Inspect `agent-browser network requests` for the exact backend search request.
3. If the result is important, probe the same backend endpoint directly with auth.
4. Take a fresh `snapshot` after the request settles.
5. Conclude from the server response plus the refreshed combobox state, not from the transient suggestion row.

This was necessary in this repo for the supplier active-only contract on `/entry/order`: a disabled supplier name could appear momentarily while typing, but the backend returned `items=[] total=0` and the refreshed combobox remained empty.

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Profile Already In Use

If the CLI reports socket or daemon startup failures such as:

- `Daemon failed to start`
- `Failed to bind socket: Address already in use`

first check whether a stale `agent-browser` daemon is still holding the session socket. In this environment, the following diagnosis worked:

```bash
ps -ax -o pid=,command= | rg 'agent-browser'
lsof -U | rg '\.agent-browser/.*\.sock|agent-browser'
```

When a stale daemon was found on `/Users/sft/.agent-browser/codex-verify.sock`, killing that daemon process fixed the issue:

```bash
kill <stale-agent-browser-pid>
```

Then retry the CLI command.

Do not treat this as a generic browser kill recipe. The target should be the stale `agent-browser` daemon that owns the socket.

### Do Not Run Same Session In Parallel

Do not launch multiple `agent-browser` commands concurrently against the same `--session`.

During verification, launching `click`, `wait`, and `eval` at the same time against `--session codex-verify` caused them to block until the earlier command finished.

Safe pattern:

- one active command at a time per session
- if you need parallel work, give each independent flow its own `--session <name>`

### Snapshot IDs Drifted

If a click or fill suddenly fails after a route change or modal open:

- rerun `snapshot`
- use the new `@e*` refs

Do not reuse stale `@e*` refs across major DOM changes.
