# Orchestration Playbook

Accumulated execution experience for subagent coordination, parallel writer management, review loops, and cross-chat continuation.

---

## Acceptance Mode Selection

- `none`: no meaningful runtime behavior change, or the user explicitly says to skip acceptance.
- `light`: the default for low-risk runtime changes when direct evidence in the task doc is enough.
- `full`: UI, multi-role, cross-page, high-risk, release-gating, or explicitly strict acceptance work; use `acceptance-qa` plus `docs/acceptance-tests/**`.

## Acceptance Guardrails

- Keep only these as hard constraints: requirement acceptance-state aggregation, audited full-mode runs, explicit `environment-gap` routing, QA not editing business code, and evidence-backed `accepted`.
- Treat everything else as mode-dependent defaults, not as a one-size-fits-all forced workflow.
- When an agent needs browser-based testing or acceptance execution, use `agent-browser` as the default execution surface so browser evidence and reproduction steps stay consistent across runs.

## 2026-04-02 · agent-browser Reference Baseline

**Source task**: user-requested browser-usage validation and documentation update
**Scenario**: the repo had a policy saying browser-based acceptance should use `agent-browser`, but it did not yet contain a validated how-to reference for agents.
**Lesson**: the policy is not enough by itself; agents also need a short, verified workflow covering page open, snapshot, interaction, network evidence, screenshot capture, and the shared-profile recovery path.
**Reusable action**: use `docs/playbooks/orchestration/agent-browser-reference.md` as the default operating note whenever a task needs browser testing or browser-backed acceptance evidence.
**Maturity**: verified ✓

## Full-Mode Closure

- Prepare or reuse an acceptance spec before full-mode execution when possible.
- Update the spec's `Latest Verification` as the default current acceptance record.
- Only create a separate acceptance run when a standalone or frozen report is justified.
- Do not archive while the current acceptance record remains `blocked`.
